  # allowedOrigins is a list of entries provided for Access-Control-Allow-Origin header

# For documentation on getting these values, visit https://www.cockroachlabs.com
database:
  # user - The user to sign in as
  user: root
  # password - The user's password
  password: ""
  # host - The host to connect to. Values that start with / are for unix domain
  # sockets. (default is localhost)
  host:
  # port - The port to bind to. (default is 5432)
  port: 26257
  # dbname - The name of the database to connect to
  dbName: usersms
  # connect_timeout - Maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Zero or not
  # specified means wait indefinitely.
  connectTimeout:
  # sslmode - Whether or not to use SSL (default is require).
  # Valid values are:
  # disable     - No SSL

  # verify-ca   - Always SSL (verify that the certificate presented
  #               by the server was signed by a trusted CA)
  # verify-full - Always SSL (verify that the certification presented by the
  #               server was signed by a trusted CA and the server host name
  #               matches the one in the certificate)
